FIRST BLOG POST IS DUE SUNDAY AT NOON!!!!

there are BLOG responses do shit online
    due before friday (you need >= 12 by the end of the quarter)


LECTURE 1 (Pre-Cinema and Early Cinema)

Earlies: Plato's Cave (Allegory of the Cave)

you have prisoners, all they know is that theyve been chained up to a cave wall
theres a lit fire and a roadway in between the fire and the prisoners, you can only see them as shadows
one prisoner is freed, and is finally taken out into sunlight for the first time in his life
holy shit people arent just shadows
goes back and tries to tell the others about what IRL is like
others think hes gone crazy

the shadow world = the first reference to cinema?

2nd reference = the camera obscura

camera = locked chamber
obscura = dark

makes everything upside down when you poke a hole in a box on the wall on the inside of the box (kinda like the eye functions)

put translucent material and trace it

eventually evolved into portable ones

SF cliffhouse has a camera obscura



NOTHER ONE: magic lantern (early image projector)

projected slides instead of moving images)
concave mirror intensified light source and projected  it onto a wall

the glass is kind of like the master, and light goes through it

other optic devices: phenakistoscope, zoetrope

phen***** = first mechanism for true animation
zoetrope = also like that, but no mirror




Joseph Nicephore Niepce: french inventor who basically invented photograhy

prolly first photograph: "View from the Window at Le Gras" 1826



captured with a camera obscura focused onto a sheet of metal plate, 8 hour exposure (didnt have the chemistry down yet to make it faster)




Eadweard Muybridge (1830-1904)

-Scenery of the Yosemite Valley (published in 1868)
one of the first ppl to analyse motion by using multiple cameras, influenced the advent of motion picture

he did that thing with the horse to see if the horse is ever airborne while running
by 1873 it was proof

12 large cameras placed in a line, and had trip strings
tried again with 20

CHRONOPHOTOGRAPHY

"a set of photographs of a moving object, taken for the purpose of recording and exhibiting successive phases of motino"

chronos = time

Etienne-Jules Marey (French, 1830-1904)

made a bunch of successive images of a moving body on the SAME negative plate (chronophotographie)

on contrast to muybridge, marey cared about how it worked than how it looked

kinda like those light paintings where you do a long exposure

made an electric photographic gun

George Eastman (American, 1854-1932)

made Kodak and invented roll film, helped bring photography to the mainstream

Thomas Edison (Wizard of Menlo Park)

motion picture camera, phonograph (early audio recordings)

invented the Kinetoscope in 1893, you need to hand crank it to roll through the film
Kinetoscope Parlor
"Fred Ott's Sneeze" one of the vids made
usually the vids are like 2 seconds and dont have sound

tthen he made the Phonokinetoscope

the people who invented filmmaking as we know it in a theater:
Auguste and Louise Lumiere (French 1862-1954 and 1864-1948)

the people that made that film where everyone ran when the train came at them (urban legend, disputed?)
cinematograph (with a magic lantern the device could be used for projection)
