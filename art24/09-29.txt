Seeing Us Listen: Synesthesia Envisioned Through Time and Various Media

Synesthesia: A rare neurological phenomenon

Ancient  Greeek "together"

commmon one: associating shapes with colors

chromasthesia, another common on: when you hear a tone or sound your brain you see colors

has been the subject of scientific investigation, mostly a mystery

a lot of artists interested in the phenomenon

synesthetic art may refer to either art created by synethetes or art reated to elicit synesthetic experience in an audience

Exceprt read from Richard Cytowic's book "The Man WhoTasted Shapes":
    they went to his house and they ate hchicken "this doesnt have enough points"
    WTF!?!?
    i taste through edges of the food, and i want the chicken to be prickly

1710: first medical reference, thomas woldhouse a blind man who experienced soudn induced color visions

this lecture is mostly about the association between music and color

louis bertrant castel, a jesuit monk and matematicitian proposes tjhe 'ocular harpsichord' in 1725
    no physical relic survived tho

he went back and revised his plans and created an ocular organ a few decades after

then, late 1800s, american bainbridge published a scheme for a corrected"" coored notes, he made a few of them
^ bainbridge bishop's color organ

color organ = instrument thats capable of playing sound and the corresponding light

Alexander Scriabin's circle of fifths: keys arranged in a circle of fifths in order to show the spectral relationship f(first in 1915 in NYC)
    he wanted everyone in the audience to wear white, the colors would change as the symphony changed so the wholeroom changes

early 20th century, light shows related to music were p popular

lots of ideas about correct relationships between notation and color

two rival organ artists during the 1920s: Danish-american Thomas Wilfred (demonstrate spiritual principles, Clavilux) he called the productions Lumia

he established an Art Institute of Light in New York
he also made Lumia boxes which were self contained boxes you could have in your home "Clavilux Junior", play the sound and their corresponding color

the other american: Mary Hallock;Greenewalt: Lebanese American inventor and pianist

best known for her visual music she called Nourather, adapted from the Arabic word for light

played sensitive music like Chopin

experimented with light modulation

messed with smooth fadeups and fadeouts with a mercury switch, became a standard tool in thermostats

people became infringing on her patants (including thomas wilfred), she tried to sue, but the judge claimed that her shit was too complex to be invented by a woman LOLOLOLOL fucking sexism

she kept developing her color organ called the ASarabet, created a special notation which did the color when you composed (????)

she didnt refer to particular notes to a color like everyone else

she reflected upon the artists ability to perform and their temperament

she always stated that there is no direct natural relationship between a sound and a color

"There is no octave to color. Colorhas no harmonics. ... Its pristine strength is such that no two .... ?????""

made a visual music phonograph kind of like edisons kinetoscope

made hand crafted films (painted on the film), which were run on that particular machine


Len Lye (1901-19080)

New Zealander-American artist who pioneered a method of film production that utilized drawing directly onto film called "drawn of film animation", "direct animation", or "animation without a camera"

Most active in filmmaking from the 30s to the 50s,  he shifted focus to work withkinetic sculpture before returning to film shortly before his death

His first fiml was a 9 minm traditional cel animation which comprised of over 9.5k drawings, named after a Samoan word suggesting "in the end feverything is just the same"

took him 2 years to make

cel animation: translucent sheets, and have individual components of the scene on each "layer" kinda like in photoshop

Len Lye's Colour Flight

you can see the film audio track on the left of the image

his shit is pretty creepy

theyre kinda biological


hes paintingn directly onto celluloid

Tusalava, Kaleidoscope, A color box and color flight, Rainbow dance

1929, 1935-37, 1936

Mary Ellen Bute (1906-1983)

A pioneer Merican Film animator significant as oneof the first female experimental filmmakers

her specialty was visual music and, while working in UNY between 34 and 53, made 14 short, abstract musical films

often used mathematical formlas as a way to construct a build up of imagery over time

often worked in collaboration with theodore (ted) nemeth, ... ?????

Mary Ellen Bute's Rhythm in Light from 1934

one of the first to experiment with computer generated shit, like oscilliscopes and stuff

she is understood to be one of the first filmmakers to experiment using elelctoronically generated imagery in filmmaking as she began to film oscilloscope patterns off of the devices screen

combined science and art, one of the first

oscilliscopes are devices that help one determine the time and voltage values of and electronic signal

used in Abstronic (1954), combining the word abstract and electronic

Oskar Fischinger (1900-1967)

german american abstract animator filmmaker and painter known for making abstract musical animation before the appearance of computer graphics and music videos

dedicated much of his life to abstraction and the connection  between sound and image, made this thing called the  lumigraph

his filmography is made of mostly short films though he collaborated on parts of some features including special effects for a fritz lang early science fictio film, woman in the moon

had a falling out with walt disney while working on fantasia because disney altered his abstract designs to be more representational. he left the production without credit for his work.

disney was determined to not make anything too abstract. had restrictions on how much characters could morph. could stretch and bend and take funny shapes but must retain their likeness (?)

examples of films using "stop motion" animation techniques

An Optical Poem, 1938
Radio Dynamics, 1942
stop motion is an animation technique where objects WALTER JUNIOR LOL WTF I KNOW THIS WHY AM I writing this DOWN ROFL

hundreds of paper cut outs on invisible wires - optical poem

Norman Mclaren (1914-1987)

scottish bron british/canadian animator, director and producer known for his work for the national film board of canada

he pioneered a number of areas within animation and filmmaking, including drawn-on-film animation )direct film), visual music, abstract film, pixilation and graphical sound

he made a shitton of stuff basically 

Begone Dull Care (1949)
    direct film, and even etched into the film and chemically alterint the film emulsion
    visual music & abstraction as well

Synchromy (1971)
    an example of mclaren's films that explor "graphicsal sound" 
        sound rirectly affiliated with the graphics content of the image = graphical sound

similar patterns visually are also put on the audio portion of the film

used simple sin waves in synchromy and the patterns were based on higher and lower frequencies

sounded pretty 8-bit

neighbors (1952)

explores "graphical sound" & "Pixilation"
                                uses live actors as stop-motion actors

Counterpoint

Besides for the abstraction generated by many music applications today, blog examples of synethetic art works made through means other tha WTF why am i writing this will be on smartsite

for blog post dont talk about visualizers



MARY ELLEN GREENWALD LOL I FORGOT TO WRITE ABOUT THAT BEFORE LEN LYE
prometheus color fire
