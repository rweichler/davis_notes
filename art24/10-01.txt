Georges Braque La guitare painting (1909-10)

Braque worked with Picasso

they worked side by side, their paintings are kind of hard to tell apart

Braque did cubism

Fernand Leger (1881-1955)

Contemporary figure

French painter, sculptor and filmmaker (only made 1 film tho not his specialty)

in his early works, he made his own personal form of cubism which he gradually modified into a more figurative, opopulist style, his boldly simplified treatment of modern subject matter was idk idki dk

Paysage (Landscape (1912-13)

The Card Players (1917)

he experienced WWI and it had a huge effect on his work

he mobilized for the french army

he almost died from mustard gas

hospitalized for a while (made the card players during recooperation)

started his "mechanical period"

The City (1919)

he starts to think about streetsigns poles and streets, and how they come into the frame. hes not replicating a vague semblance of the city itself but hes observing and rendering parts and pieces within a compositional strategy

Three Women (1921)

Ballet Mecanique (1924) Dudley Murphy & Fernand Leger

from the cubic artist, this film is considered by some as a dadaist post-cubist work of art

watching a vid now

sounds like ur in a factory

and it looks like a bad trip

lots of swinging back and forth
lots of looping of th e same shit

like this chick smiling and not smiling over and over

vid over

the soundtrack can be different, but its most in line with the desires he had to accompany the film

adds the anxiety of that piece

from the cubic artist, this film is considered by some as adadaist post-cubist work of are influenced by futurisFuturism

Futureism

Another early 20th century art movement and artistic phil heralded by "tthe founding and manifesto of futurism" written by the italian poet filippo tommaso marinette in 1909

futurism was a rejection of the past, and a celebration of speed, machinery, violence, youth and industry; it began advocating for the modernization and cultural rejuvenation of italy

"we want to sing about the love of danger .... courage boldness and rebellion will be the essnetial elements of or poetry" - from the maifesto

Giacomo Ball "Dynamism of  a dog on a leash" (1912)
    good example of futurist painting
    
attemps at rendering movement in ways that havent been done before

"The art of noise" 1939 by luigi russolo describes alternate method and possibilities for orchestral sound by to include everyday noised simulated by mechanical means into their productions

    hes a painter and he um... in this image thats him on the left, and his friend piatte around 1913 they stand amidst his musical instruments "noise intoners" laid out by the principles in his manifesto
    
list of noises hes interested in mechanisim: roars, claps, ralling water, driving, bellows
    2. whistles, snores snorts
    3. gurgles
    4. shrilll sounds,s huffles,
    5. ???
    6. animal and human ovces shouts moans screams laughter sobs
    
Luigi Russolo, ?Dynamism of a Car" (1912-1913)

Future painter Arnaldo Ginna and his brother writer Bruo Corra made at least nine films by painting directly on the fil strip as far back as 1910 (pre dating Len Lye). Sadly none have survived

in 1912, Bruno Corra also writes "Abstract Cinema-Chromatic Music" an essay calling for color film symphonies and visual music

Arnaldo Ginna, La Musica Della Danza (The Music of Dance) (1911)

Russian avant-garde

Much larger than an art movement per se, the Russian avant garde contained many movements

At the early part of the 20th century, Russian artists were fueled by the charge of two revolutions (1905 and 1917) that eventually rid the country of imperial rule. Reinvention was in the air broguth in by a new Marxist state led by Lenin

and... heres a rather large country of millions of people thathas just been throguh 2 revolutions.... 1905 is a puppet parliament, then 1917, the imperialist empire was overthrow....... but umm..... and film.... as lenin understood it the new leader, USSR, understood as a new communication device that could unify this rather large country of very diverse ethnicities andpeoples

for the sake of staying on the subject of cinema we will focus on 3 filmmakesr/theorist that changed the way we think of film in the early 20th century:L

    Lev Kuleshow, Sergei Eisenstein, Dziga Vertov

Lev Kuleshov (1899-1970)

He taught at and helped to establish the Moscow Film School, the worlds first school geared towards film

Most known for his theories on editing, the Kuleshov effect (illustrate here)

show scene of food, show mans face, OH HES HUNGRY
showdead person show same mans face OH HES MOURNING
show chick sleeping, show same mans face, OH HES LUSTFUL

the meaning of the silm was not only in spatial composition but in the arrangement of shots
smiling -> gun pointed at him -> scared : oh hes powerless

scared -> gun -> smiling : oh hies courageous / might be holding the gun

earlier filmmakes like the use filmmaker dw griffith pioneered "continuity editing" through practice but almost as an extension of the 19th century theatrical methods

continuity editing is cutting between the shots with the purpose of maintaining a smooth sense of continuous space and time. griffith developed continuity editing style through cutting and through techniques such as the 1080 degree rule. he experimented and developed establishing shots, reverse shots, and cutting on action.


you see a show of a building, cut to the character syou are going to assume are in the building "establishing shots"

building or space that you cut inside of ^^^^

reverse shots: you have a kind of someone saying something to someone else, then reverse to the other dude responding to him

cutting on action: say yim throing a dart, as soon as my hand lets go, the next edit is the dart landing into the target

Sergei Eisenstein

Eisenstein thought of editing more intellectually and developed montage (the process or tecnique of selecting, editing, and pieceing together separate section fo film to forma continuous whole) through theory.

he would establish ways in which to break frree from the continuitites of space idk hes too fast


he blelieved film editing worked much like a Hegelian Dialectic

Which explains his metaphors on editing as conflict and collision of ideas

HEGELIAN DIALECTIC: Thesis, tension,antithesis, synthesis, REPEAT OVER AND OVER

5 methods of montage:

metric - cutting to the length of shot, beat, temp
    thinking of the length or tiime of film rather than cutting to music
    5 5 5 10 5 5 5 10
rythmic - time and tempo of movement inside the frame of the shot
    there might be some kinf of rhythmic action, the n cut to the crowd moving away from the soldiers
tonal - less concerned with time than with the lighting, shadows, and shapes in the frame, cut between shot of various tones
    close up, then far away shot, then understanding these things ar ein tension with each other
        like a baby carriage near stairs
over-tonal - larger macro-cell that combines the above three methods
intellectual or ideological montage - symbolic editing like three shots of a stone lio n at the end of his most famous film sequence the odessa steps from battleship potemkin, representing the rise of the proletariat

    the odessa steps it he symbolization of the conflict between the fsoldiers and the peopl
    
BOUTTA WATCH THAT SHITe

it honestly was just a meh movie but i guess it was pretty good for 1905

DONE WITH THE MOV

thei r running away from the soldiers and they trample the kid and then she picks her up after everyones gone and goes back to teh soldiers holding thers on up and like plz help but they fukin kill her anyway cuz lol

Dziga Vertov

A soviet pioneer documentary film, newsreel director and cinema theorist
released kino-pravda, a series of films that means film truth
he believed the kino-eye would influence the actual evolution of man, "from a bumbling citizen through the poetry of the machine to the perfect electric man"

"in the face of the machine we are ashamed of mans inability to control himself .... ??"

be believes like a camera is a machine eye and can somehow evolve humankind or some shit?

it kind of goes to morning and your daily life..... its just like throughout the fday and it always references film YOU SHOULD WATCH THIS

battleship of potekimin??? THATST THE NAME!????

the impact of this film: it influenced vertov's man witha amovie camera was a metaphor for todays technological world.

artist perry bard constructs and interface in which participands can upload shots for a contemprary re-enactment over the internet of vertrovs masterpiece "Man with a movie Camera"
