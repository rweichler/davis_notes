"happenings", a term originally coined by artist allen kagrow

Carolee Schneemann

-befriends allen kaprow shortly after staging her own Happening titled A Journey through a Disrupted Landscape
-Her first experience of experimental film came after being introduced to Stan Brakhage by her lover musician James Tenney
-Scheemann begins to develop her own unique kind of Body Art where she considered the body as a central medium



one of her earliest works is a series of photographs called "Eye Body: 36 transformative actions"

one of her most famous "Happenings" was performed in 1964 at the Festival de la Libre Expression, Paris called "Meat Joy"
    erotic, celebration of flesh (?), prolpulsion towards the extatic, wildness, sensual, comic, repellant
    its really messy, just a bunch of underwear clad people touching each other and moving around and dousing themselves in paint and shit

Carolee Schneemann, Viet Flakes (1965): composed from an obsessive collection of Vietame  atrocity images, compiled over 5 years, from foreign magazines and newspapers
    video of a bunch of vietname pics lol wtf
    bunch of weird music in the background that keeps cutting out
    lotta pics of distressed viatnamese ppl and american soldiers
    "frenetic collage" -prof
    the reason why vietname was so contentious (besiesdes the draft) it was not highly- it was the first televised war - it was a bunch of images you dont necessarily see today in afghanistan

Another contrext in which Caroele Schnememann is working is within is 2nd was wave feminism, a movement iin the US begun in the early 1960s which broadened the equality from early struggles fora womans right to vote and own property towards a wide range of equality issues including those dealing with sexuality, workplace discrimination, reproductive rights, and other legal in equalities.

though not always her goal, schneemann offers her own brand of feminist art that uniquely revolves around sexual expression and the body

in her book cezane, she was a g reat painter she states some shit that he changed the slide before i could type it out
"Autobiographical Trilogy"
Fuses was made to depict sexual intimacy andpleasure from a womans point of vie
Plumb Line depicts the dissolution of a relatioship
Kitches Lost Meal documented the everyday life experience of her life in rural NY w her lover Anthony Mcacal and their cat Kitch?

Fuses is the best known prolly (also most controversial)

J Tenney and her love make through a film that has been painted, stained, burnt and collaged. Schneemann was motivated by the desire toknow oif a womans depiction of her own sexual acts was different from pornography andclassical art
    it actually shows dicks and shit
    cuts from sex to cats and dcar rides and shit
    superimposes them making out on a beach over vid of fuckin
    ppaints over a lot ofthee slides
    not really meant for arousal like for porn its more abrasive and shit

plumb line
    double printed 8mm film and showed it at 16mm, basically depicrts  relationship

Interior Scroll - The Cave
    she takes a scroll out of her vagina and reads the text

Up to and Including Her Limits 1973-76
    a series of perofmrnances that turned where she transformed th film and video documentation into an installation of the same name
    action painting
    inserting herself into the at world thatwas mostly male dominated

Infinity Kisses (2008)

one by laura muldy, not the easiest text, not related to carolee schneemann. but goes into the notion and privilege of the male gaze and male vision within culture and how it ???? filmlmmaking, and traditional narrative filmmaking, but its a highly influential text and influenced expereimental filmmakers and artists. if you think sthink about holy wood and the culture industry and theres only been one woman who won best director for a major motion picture. there still is a prevelant male-dominant culture that exists within the cultural industry. schneemann is a great example of someoeone that rallies against it but also pays respect to we as human understand who we are through the sensations of our bodies
