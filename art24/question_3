the first part of the question asks what a trance film is
    its a film that involves the filmmakers anterior quest
    learning about themselves or the subconscious
    has some sort of sexual content to it
    maya deren is more learning about themselves than sexual
they both have symbolism
    meshes in the afternoon had shorter cuts
fireworks seemed more like a theatre film in terms of shots
more montage in meshes

influence:
    kenneth anger liked hollywood (more established longer shots)
    he has a more narrative sense
symbols: macho sailor
meshes: key, knife phone etc

they both had isolation in their own life
meshes: maya was an immmigrant
kenneth anger was gay
