History & Immigration
Chinese Americans
-One of the earliest immigrants
-In the late 1800s, occupied low paying jobs
    -Chinese Exclusion Act (1882): barred the entry of Chinese laborers
    -Paper sons - Chinese claiming relations to those already in the U.S.

like, the gold rush was one of them. but obvs most people didnt make it thru.
so they worked mostly menial jobs and were laborers.

most people know that they helped build the transcontintental railroad

what happened after?

mostly found low-paying jobs

in the late 1800s when the US economy went sour, the chinese immigrants were seen as a scapegoat, taking away the jobs from other americans.

enter Chinese Exclusion Act
    bar chinese laborers from entering the US

was extended indefinitely in 1902

Chinese Laborers (typically males) were  not allowed to enter


"Paper sons"
1906: SF earthquake destroyed a lot of documents
people immigrating to the US claimed to be related to the people living in the US
no longer seen as a laborer, but as a family member. loophole around exclusion act



-Dramatic change in sentiment around WWII
    -Chinese Americans were seen in a more favorable light

China was part of the allies in WWII. Shift in attitude towards Chinese immigrants
Chinese people wore a pin to differentiate themselves from Japanese people for example

-Immigration Act of 1965
    -Chinese immigrants consisted primarily of professionals

in the 1800s, lets say 50 visas were granted for all of the asian continents. later the total # of visas granted would be 2% of people who are living in the US.

IMmigration act changes the way that visas were granted. Given to professionals and helped with reuniting family members

thats were the stereotype came from. asians are hardworking smart etc etc.



-Japanese Americans
    -entered the US during the 1800s as a contract farm laborers in Hawaii
    -Gentlement's Agreement Act (1908)
        -Picture Brides
        -Balanced ration of men and women
        -2nd generation of Japanese Americans

Japanese immigrants had more financial capital with them than chinese ppl
They allowed Japanese people to buy their own farms

after a while, when people started to see them starting to do well, they started to become the target of animosity


Gentlemen's Agreement act: barred japanese laborers from coming to the US
"Picture brides": arranged marriages between japanese men in the US and japanese women in japan. then the wives flew over

since a lot of marriages took place, there were in tact families, youd see a lot of 2nd generation japanese families in the USA

-WWII -> forced relocation into internment camps
FDR signed order 9066
    idea was to monitor them to see if there were spies

-South Asian AMericans
    -Farmers
    -Racially unclassified
        -US v. Bhagat Singh Thind - South Asian AMericans were seen as non-white and could not be naturalized
    -Immigration Act of 1965
    -Identity of South Asians: Are SA "Asian"

Yuba City, Stockton, Fresno, so forth
at the time it was argued that there are 3 major races. caucasoid, mongoid race, negroid race. people saw indians as more caucasoid.

different states gave people citizenship on different bases.

Singh wanted citizenship in Washington. Denied on the basis that he was not partr of the caucasoid race. Went all the way up to the Supreme Court. He did not fit the assumption of what a typical white person is. Everyone prior to him was stripped of their citizenship

Immigration Act: more educated, professionals

classifying south asians vs middle eastern: hard... because of religion? but pakistani people share religion with middle easterns

Korean Americans
-The poor living conditions in Korea coupled with the need for laborers in Hawaii led to many immigrants
-Another wave of immigrants came in the 1950s
    -Primarily the wives of servicemen (War brides) and war orphans
    -Orphans experienced not fitting in with other from their community and yet feeling different from their adopted families
-Immigration Act of 1965 -> though professionally skilled, many were unable to find jobs due to language barriers.
    -Opened up small businesses

during the korean war, many women came thru because the men soldiers married korean women and petitioned for them to migrate

lots of orphans lived with their extended families. felt as outsiders in all senses of the word.

Filipino Americans
-Philippines was colonized by the US in 1898
    -Filipinos were seen as Natinoals
-Tydings-McDuffie Act (1934), Filipinos were deemed as no longer "Nationals"

now they were seen as just immigrants, and now they have experiences similar to the other asian groups

-Combination of SPANISH RULE AND COLONIZATINO FROM THE WEST, FILIPINO CULTURE HAS EASTERN AND WESTERN INFLUENCE
-3 WAVES:
    -1909-1934: LABORERS AND COLLEGE STUDENTS (PENSIONADOS)
    -1930-1964: FAMILIES OF WAR VETERANS
    -1965-1984: BOTH PROFESSIONALS AND WORKING CLASS
sorry caps

Southeast Asians
-Group compromised of refugees and voluntary immigrants
-3 waves, each defined by a distinguishing set of circumstances and struggles
    -1975-1978: Elite group of SEA migrated
    -1978: diverse background, less educated and urbanized
    -1982: Orderly Departure Program - granted immigrant status rather than refugee status; released prisoners from camps and Amerasian children

they had to leave their wartorn countries because they were being persecuted by their communist government
not everybody could afford to come at the same time
evenif families could come together... not everyone survived

first wave: they were high risk. highly educated. had ties with the US government. they were seen as a threat and were persecuted. the US govt made sure that these people were evacyated immediately. fluent in english etc. their experiences were quite different from the other ppl that came after. somewhat familiar with the culture etc
2nd wave: "boat people" diverse in terms of social class and ethnic group.

the us was lije, there needs to be  a safer way for ppl to leave southeast asia
hence, orderly departure program
