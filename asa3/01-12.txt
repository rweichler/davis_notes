Asian Americans as "model Miorities"
-Asiam immigrants prior to 1965
    -Primarily malers
    -Primarily laborers
-Asian immigrants post 1965 Immigration Act
    -Skilled professionals
    -Families
-The national landscape of the 1960's was one that challenged race relations
    -Dec 26, 1966: US News and World Report printed a story titled "Success Story of One Miority in the U.S."
    "At a time when it is being proposed that hundreds of biullions be spent to uplift Negroes and other minorities, the nation's 300,000 Chinese Americans are moving ahead on their own, with no help from anyone else."
_similar piece in the New York Times about Japanese Americans

 "model miority" is bad for both people who fit hte stereotype and those who dont


 Criticisms of "Model Minority"
 -There were unwarranted assumptions made about the progress of Asian Americans
    -Disaggregating data
    -Comparisons between AA and their white counterparts were not equal

South Asians don't have higher amounts of success as East Asians???
    if you average out ???

Like most asians live in coastal states and cities with higher cost of living which isnt really a fair comparison to white people

-The comparisons with other racial groups were harmful, generating ill feelings with the underlying message that other minorities should stop complaining and work hard to achieve the American Dream
    -Racial Triangulation Theory

Racial Triangulation THeory:

-Racism against Asian Americans peaks according to poliitical conditions:
    1940s, 1950s, 1959-1975, 180s, 9/11/2001

1882: Chinese Exclusion Act
1908: Gentleman's Agreenment Act
1924: Immigration Act of 1924
1942: Executive Order 9066

1959-1975: Vietnam war.
1980s: Racism directed mainly at JapaneseAmericans, but then because some people might not see the difference between the asian groups, so it carries over to other asians.

Vincent Chin: lots of asians wer ethe target of discrimination because our auto industry wasn't doing so great (but Japan's was booming at the time) there were a lot of people who were losing their jobs because our auto industry was failing at the time.

It's interesting as we go through history its funny to see history repeat itself. Something similar happened in our recent recession as well (not as bad as the 1980s). "Let's not buy foreign cars" kinda shit with Detroit going down the shitter.

Nobody felt threatened driving foreign cars today. People actually felt threatened during the 1908s.


9/11: Changed the way different groups have bene percieved




-Japanese Internment - significant example of prejudice and discrimination
    -Executive Order 9066: Removal of all those who were of Japanese ancestry
    -2/3 imprisoned were U.S. citizens by birth
    -Considered to be a "military necessity"

we didnt intern italians or germans.

researchers say that its because japan bombed pearl harbor

but it was also that... since there was already existing anti-asian sentiment. it was easier to implement this anti- policu. there wasnt this anti german or anti italian sentiment dubefore wwii


psychological consequences of being interned was noted after and continues on with more recent articles.
    subsequent generations who have had family members who were interned at the time. shit like nobody wanted to talk about it; lets move on etc. there wasnt a lot that was known until re cently where people were proed and family members wanted to share some info about the shit they went through.

    one of the more obvious consequences was they didnt know how long they were gonna be in these camps.

-Psychological consquences
    -Uncertainnty of the future
    -Breakdown of famioly role structures
    -Feelings of shame and humiliation for being Japanense
    -Self blame
    -Anxiety of being separated from family
    -Self conscious about their heritage
    -Lowered sense of self esteem
-Less apparent racism directed at Japanese-Americans during the 1908s
    -"Economic enemy": basically when  that had to do with how the japanese auto industry was booming during the 1908s and here it was the opposite and azns were seen as an economic threat
