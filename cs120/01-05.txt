1. Foundation of computing

State machines, pushdown automatic, turing machines

church-turing thesis
    turing machine is an abstract mathematical model for computing
    what we know as computing is what turing machines can compute
    we take it on faith, theres no proof for it?

limits of computing
    things we fundamentally cannot do
    when we analyze what a turing machine and what it can do then
    its lke oh ok we can never possibly do this
    a lot of them arent terribly difficult to explain
    Mathametician named David Hilbert (prolific around the turn of the 20th century)
    he gave this address at the turn of the 20th century
    "here are all the most important mathematical questions we should work on in the next 100 years"
    Hilbert's 10th Problem
    Solvability of Diaphantine Equations
        its something that looks a lot like a polynomial
        ex: 3x^2 + 2x = 0
            4x^10 + 8y^6 = 0

    10th problem: find an algorithm to determine if a diaphantine equation has a solution (integer solutions)
    
    nobody found an algorithm

    david hilbert assumed that its reasonable to ask
    but there is no algorithm for it

    ~1970 people finally resolve this
    Davis, Putnam, Robinson, Matisguerick
        proved that no such allgorithm can exist (caveat: algorithm = something a turing machine can compute)


Other examples that are more down to earth:
    Software verification (problem we're not gonna solve)
        knowing program on any input does the right thing
            question is too general, you need to narrow it down before answering it
        Halting problem (we'll do this in class)
            Q: on a given input, will a program stop or run forever (infinite loop)?

These are undecidable proglems (loosely means not solvable)

State Machines
    Loosely:
        Directed graphs (analogy)
        Start state ("vertex")
        transition states depending on input ("arcs"/"edges")
ex: small binary adder
    gonna have a not-carry state and a carry state

the second part of the inner loop is actually a separate loop
but i was too lazy to draw it out in text ^^^^^

why study state machines?
    -we dont wanna start at turing machines (that would be awful)
        -the idea is to slowly build
    -state machines have relationships to regular expressions, programming languages, compilers

LOOK OVER 20 SHIT this class will be hard
sit in on the class

How will we study state machiens?
    4: Formal language theory

**side note:dont use intuition when writing homework/programs, only to explain it to others

Def: Alphabet <sigma> or <gamma> to denote this (typical solution)

ex. <sigma><sub B> = {0, 1} (binary alphabet)
    <sigma><sub eng> = {a, b, ..., z, A, ..., Z} (latin alphabet)

Def: A symbol of an alphabet <sigma> is an elemebt of <sigma>
ex. 0 is a symbol of <sigma><sub B>

Def: a string over an alphabet <sigma> is a finite sequence (orde rmatters) of symbols
-> In general, a string w over <sigma> is is w1w2'...'wn with wi <within symbol <sigma> for all 1 <= i <= n and n >= 0

ex. x = 1011 is a string over <sigma><sub B>

Def: The Length of a string w is the number of symbols in it, denoted |w|
ex. |x| = 4

Def: The *empty string* (typically denoted <epsilon> or <lambda>, prof will be using <epsilon>) is the string of length 0. (not *a* string, *the* string.... theres only one)

Caution: We often abuse this notation and we use <epsilon> almost like a symbol

the state machine can take an epsilon transition aka it takes nothing (??)
Remark: the alphabet we study does not have <epsilon> (the empty string) as a symbol

Def: <sigma><super *> = set of all strings over <sigma>

        = {w1w2'...'wn n>=0 wi <within> <sigma> for all 1 <= i <= n}

    note <epsilon><within><sigma><super *> alwayss since n=0 implies the string is the empty string

    Note: if n = 0 then there are no 'i' between 1 and n so we dont check the "wi <within> <sigma> for all 1 <= i <= n" condition, it is always true. We call this 'vacuously true'.

ex. <sigma><sub B><super *> = {<epsilon>, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, ...}
            ^^^^ this is not the power set (almsost but not exactly)


Def: A *language* over <sigma>: Any subset of strings over <sigma>


Ex. {0, 1, 111, 01} <= <sigma><sub B><super *> so it is a language over <sigma><sub B>

Example: <sigma><sub num> = {0, 1, ..., 9, '-', '.'}  (12 symbols)

ex. Integer <fancy Z> = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...} is a language over <sigma><sub num>


q from student: are language designed to narrow down our input?
    fuck couldn't pay attention to answer

could you have a language over multiple alphabets?
    naw just combine the alphabets

ex. -2 <within> <fancy Z><sub STR>
    Q: What is the length of -2?
    A: 2 ('-' and '2')

ex. Note -1.9 <within><sigma><sub NUM><super *> \ <fancy Z><sub STR>
 the \ means NOT

Recall: A\B = |x| such that x <within> a and x <not within> B




------> Our main interest throughout the quarter:
            Given a language A over an alphabet <sigma>, can I build a state machine / pushdown autotama / turing machine that recognizes A?

        recognizes means: If w <within> <sigma><super *>, my machine definitevely tells us ocorrectly that w <within> A or not.



it turns out that if we find things that are just limited to this study then we'll find shit for  the general study???
