implicit (algebraic):
    x^2 + y^2 = 1
explicit:
    y = sqrt(1-x^2)
parametric:
    c(t) -> x(t), y(t)
    x=sin(t)
    y=cos(t)
    0 > t > pi/2

parametric is the most OP for 3D modeling

Interpolation
make a bunch of points, tell the computer to figure out how to make a cbeautiful curve go throguh it
    C-1 contonious: shitty blocks going through the points you specify
    C 1: shitty triangle
    C 1 also?: nice curve

continuity!!!!!
