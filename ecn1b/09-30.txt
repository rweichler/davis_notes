GDP Also Equals Total Expenditure

AKA equals the amount of money people spend on shit too

What happens to the goods and servicess produced?

    What kind of things produces these things?
        Firms, Households, government
    What happens to the things we produce?
        They're sold or not sold



Does it count in GDP?

            Sold    Not sold
Firms       A       B
Households  C       D
Government  E       F

A: count in at market prices
B: count in at market prices (as if producers themselves buy them) (changes in inventories)
C: count in at market prices
D: does not count in GDP
E&F: count in at cost of providing the service

only D does not count in GDP

we categorize consumers into 4 different groups:
    households, firms, ogovernment, foreign counties

example dude making bread

intermediate good: flour and shit: $50
value added: cooking the bread: $60
final goods: $110

value added = wage + interest+ rent + profit

breh breh brehbreh breh breh breh breh breh breh breh breh breh breh breh

the intermediate good also has its own intermediate good and value added

e.g. the bread has an intermediate good that costs $20
and the value added was $30

and then THAT intermediate good also has ITS own shit
e.g. the intermediate good is $0 and the value added was $20

since theres so much shit, you only count the final good, which uis $110

you could also add up all the value added's

GDP = tital factor income (income made by factors of production as a result of producing the goods and services comprising GDP)

HOW ABOUT CAPITAL GAINS!!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!

gapital gains = money madfe on investments

they dont go into the fuking GDP u fuking retard are u fukin dum no shit was made

GDP = value of production = total expenditure = total factor income

Production
    total value of goods and services produced
    GDP = P1*Q1 + .....

Expenditure
    FUCK I MISSED THE REST

Income
    FUCK FUCK



CHART TIME (real GDP at constant 2009 prices (base year = 2009))

Nominal and Real GDP
Year    P1      Q1      P2      Q2      Nom GDP     Real GDP
2008    $5  *   2   *   $10 *   $4  =   $50         $60
2009    $6  *   4   +   $12 *   5   =   $84         $84
2010    $8  *   6   +   $15 *   6   =   $138        $108


to get the real GDP, we use the same quantity, but use base years price
so for this instance, we use the $6 and $12 from 2009

real makes u visualize the quantity of shit produced

nominal wage: kinda like you get paid $100k a year in the bay vs $60 k a year in portland
but portland might have better real wages cuz the cost of living in the bay is a fukton
but the bay still has better nominal wages

nominal is basically who gives a fuk, tell me the REALity

economic growth = long term incerase in real GDP

FRED = federeal reserve economic data

Price Index:

$20     *       5 Pizzas    =   $100
nominal expenditure = $100
real expenditure = 5 pizzas

Price = nominal/real = $100/(5 pizzas) = $20

GDP Deflator

(Nominal Thing) = Price * (Real Thing)
Nominal GDP = (GDP Deflator) * (Real GDP)

SOMETHING ANNOYING: in published data,
GDP Deflator = (Nom GDP)/(Real GDP) * 100

from that chart above, the GDP Deflator is:

2008: 50/60 * 100 = 83
2009: 84/84 * 100 = 100
2010: 138/108 * 100 = 128

GDP and Welfare: Is GDP a good indicator of the welfare (wellbeing) of a nation?

1. Real GDP is more relevant to well-being
2. Real GDP per capita is even better
3. Silent about distribution of GDP
4. Includes things that we don't consume (like what?)
    (includes anti aircraft misiles)
5. Excludes things that we do consume (like what?)
    imported french wine and shit
6. "Bads" are not accounted for (like what?)
    weed, LSD, coke, AK47s shit like that
7. Intangibles are not included (examples?)
    leisure time, health

Consumer Price Index

CPI in a year = (cost of buying the basket in that year) / 
                (cost of buying the basket in 1982-84)
                        * 100

GDP deflator is a fantasy word for the average price of all the goods that are in the GDP

it is not a good example of the average income
    it includes a lot of items we dont use
    it excludes things we buy (like imports and drugs)

back to the CPI

the basket is about a bunch of shit that most ppl buy like bananas and gamecubes and shit, and they figure out how much that entire basket costs



CHART TIME

for 1982-84
Basket      Quantity        Price       Cost of Living

Apples      10              $2          $20
Bread       20              $1          $20
Cheese      15              $3          $45
Donuts      5               $1          $5
Total                                   $90

now do it for different years, but keep the quantity the same

for 2008: 
price       COL
2.40        24
1.20        24
3.60        54.00
1.20        6
total       108

2015
price       COL
2.52        25.20
1.26        25.20
3.78        56.70
1.26        6.30
total       113.40


problem with this, cuz now we have iPhones and tofu but we didnt have those in 1984

the CPI is fuking insanely going up BTW

the 100 is a base year, 82-84
