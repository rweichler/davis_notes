a single firms demand for labor

a single firms hiring decision to maximise profit

MPL > W/P

stop as soon as MPL = W/P





W/P down - for a given productivity, ???????

if the copmany gets more capital, will that company hire more labor?
    IT DEPENDS

if the capital is a substitute for labor
    hire less
    ex: robots

capital is a complement for labor
    hire more
    ex: trucks need drivers

CHANGES in TECHNOLOGY

definition of technology: outlet of producing

technologycal progress = learning better ways of producing


INCREASE IN TEHCNOLOGY -> IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU NEED MORE LABOR

either technology is labor-saving or labor-using



MPL goes up when for a given real, wage amount demanded increases (shift)


GRAPH:


y axis is W/P (1-5)
x axis is L (200-700)

the first line is a slope of -1, the second line is also a slope of -1 but shifted to the right

Supply of Labor and Labor Force

what is the difference between the supply of labor and labor force?
    nothing, they're the same

S sub(L) = Labor Force
S sub(L) = (Labor Force)/Population * Population
S sub(L) = (LF Participation Rate) * Population
S sub(L) = 75% * 100,000,000 = 75,000,000

if Real Wage increases, then will people want to work more?
    it depends

Substitution Effect:
    if real wage increwases, then people will substitute labor for liesure
            less leisure and more labor
            why? because the opportunity cost increases
    if substitution effect, then the OG question is "yes"

Income Effect:
    if real wages increases, then people will work less because they wanna get paid the same amount
    if income effect,  then the OG question is "no"


in addition to real wage, you also have:
culture, social norms
economic and technological development

Sggregate Supply of Labor
GRAPH
W/P is y, L is X
the SL is a line with a slope of 1
W/P = 1-6, L = 100-600
SL is the labor force (# of people willing and able to work)

W/P goes down = for a given population, LF participation goes down (movement)

population increase, culture, etc, fuck I MISSED IT

Labor Market Equilibrium: SL = DL

SL = total # of people willing and able to work
DL = total jobs available, filled and vacant

^^^ Full Employment ^^^

Short Run and Long Run

Long Run: amount of time wages and prices are fully flexible
    capital can change
    tech can change (tech = knowledge of how to produce)

Short Run:
    capital cant change
    tech cant change
    wages and prices are sticky (cant change fast)


bor Market Equilibrium is a point on the graph where DL and SL intersect

when CPI goes down, W/P goes up, then the supply (# of ppl willing to work) goes up and now we have unemployment=

unemployment is caused by excess supply of labor

e.g. price of iphone goes down, cant hire as many ppl, so you lay them off

suppose the price of the iphone doubles, then W/P (real wage) goes down, so they wanna hire more people
    now we have excess demand for labor, so then wages go up, then the real wage remains constant

in this model, when demand and supply are unchanging, then a change in price, there will be a change in nominal wage, and then real wage will stay constant

real wage = W/P
nominal wage = W
labor = L
price = P
