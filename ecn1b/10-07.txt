suppl3 of labor is everyone who wants to work EVERYONE


demand of labor is the number of people you want to work for you EVERY COMPANY EVERYONE EVERYONE even then people who are working right now




full employment = # of people who want to work == # of jobs available
NOT that everyone is employed


W/P is REAL WAGE

with every change, it will deviate towards for real wage

if you increase P, then W will also increase so W/P stays the same

P is price for your commodity
W is wage you pay your workkers

Potential GDP

Potential GDP is the index of the amount of all the goods and ser vices that can be produceds when all the resources of the economuy are fully employed

basically the GDP we would have if we had full employment

potential GDP is real GDP not nominal

if our GDP = potential GDP, then we have full employment

we can produce more than our potenteial GDP

increase of demand of labor = incirease of real wage, see fig C

increase in supply brings down the real wage

Long Run Behavior of RWages and Prices

in the absence of changes in productivity, popuylation, or labor force participation rate,

(delta W)/W = (delta P)/P -> W/P remains constant

second

increases in productivity cause W/P to increase

third

increases in population and participation rate cause W/P to decrease

labor force participation rate has been steadily decreasing for men since 1949

for eomen its been steadily increasing until around 1996, then it started to go down at the same rate as men
