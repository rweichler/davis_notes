around 2004 the potential GDP has started to go down a little bit, its kinda cheating?

why is potential going down?
    def: what we can produce if everyone has a job

some ppl think that the recession could be with us for the rest of our lives


Business Cycles

GDP Gap = Y(p) - Y
the real GDP is like a sin wave that goes around the potential GDP which is a line
    above it and below it
    the potential GDP is like slope of 0.5

it always going back to the potential GDP is called the "self correcting mechanism" of free market capitalist system - ronald reagan

short run is like one of these business cycles

If in the long run real GDP equals potential, why does unemployment rate not equal zero?

REASON: Natural Unemployment

-> unemployemt that exists even when real GDP equals potential GDP, in the long run

1. Frictional unemployment
    unemployment because of friction (DUH)
    frictions in the labor market
    frictions due to imperfection
    it takes time for people to find jobs
    more short term
    5 EE grads, 5 EE jobs, EVENTUALLY they will find the job, but it will take a while

2. Structural unemployment
    unemployment because of changes in the structure of industries
    like companies relocating HQ and employees cant also relocate
    robots
    more long term
    cashier looking for a job, grocery store looking for a SWE to make a self-checkout

3. Minimum wage unemployment
    companies hire people cuz people produce things that the companies sell
    say you provide $10 worth of value to McDs
    then they hike minimum wage to $15
    well shit this is not worth anymore
    so they fire you

4. Efficiency wage unemployment
    more controversial, some ppl dont believe in it
    some companies pay higher wages to certain employees to get their loyalty
    by paying them higher wages, they're gonna make you work harder
        "if i fuck up then i will have to find a job that pays cheaper"




Cyclical Unemployment

happens cuz of business cycles, but mostly recessions

"Unemployment due to business cycles"

u = u(n) + u(c)

u(n): natural unemploynent <------ we always have this
u(c): cyclical unemployment <---- only in a recession




Unemployment & GDP

u = u(n) + u(c)
GDP Gap = Y(p) - Y

what is the relationship between these?

Y = Y(p), then u = u(n), therefore GDP Gap = 0 and u(c) = 0
Y < Y(p), then u > u(n), therefore GDP Gap > 0 and u(c) > 0
Y > Y(p), then u < u(n), therefore GDP Gap < 0 and u(c) < 0

cyclical unemployment can be negative

Discouraged Workers

when obama claimed that unemployment was going down, it was prolly ppl that were discouraged and stopped looking for jobs so they weren't included in the unemployment stats

like unemployment benefits go away after 2 yrs so you dont bother going again to be counted in the statistics

(well now its 4 years because of obama)

u = Unemployed/(Labor Force) * 100

if a worker becomes discouraged, then # of numerator or denominator goes down by 1

e.g. 5/100 -> 4/99 

Costs of Unemployment

-Economics Costs
    they wont be able to produce things
-Social Costs
    psychological problems
    more crimes
    ppl feel shitty about themselves


Okun's Law
calculated relationships between cyclical unemployment rate and percent GDP gap

percent GDP seems to be 1.68x cyclical unemployment rate

(Y(p) - Y)/Y(p) = 1.68*u(c)

Okun's Alpha is the 1.68, but that doesnt mean it's always that, just most of the time its around that ballpark

Benefits of Unemployment
-Inflation
    wages go down, then prices go down (LOL WTF)
_Efficiency
    companies learn to operate with fewer workers
    workers do more shit
