CHAPTER 5

Inflation

read the book go through the slides and read the study guide = everything on the midterm

low potential GDP -> UNEMPLOYMENT

yeah dude

Inflation

Increase Over Time in the General Price Level

increase in the general price level over many periods

Inflation Rate (pi) = (P(new) - P(old))/P(old) * 100

Should we use GDP deflator or CPI for P?
    idk

Three Kinds of Price Change

Inflation (P higher & pi > 0)

Deflation (P lower & pi < 0)

deflation SUX

Disinflation (P higher & pi lower)
    CONCAVE DOWN

Stagflation is the combination of 2 words
    stagnation = recession
    and inflation

    when price of oil increased, then the price of almost everything else increased
    therefore people started to buy fewer things
    then companies produced fewer things
    since they were not producing as much as before, they had to lay off people
    high inflation and high unemployment HENCE STAGFLATION


Costs of Inflation

Cost to the society as a whole when pi > 0 relative to when pi = 0

how things will be without inflation, suppose all the prices were fied year after year

and compare this to where prices are increasing naturally (5% per year, etc etc)

1. Wasteful Economic Activities (to protect the value of money)
    like dont put your money under your mattress,
    you invest it in a bank instead so inflation
    doesnt make your money absolutely worthless

nflation erodes the value of money
Shoe-Leather costs
wage negotiations and labor contracts (are due to inflation)

What is the social cost?
    TIME

2. Menu Costs (costs of changing prices)
    restaurants have to change their menus every year

Inflation and interest rates

interest rates must be greater than or equal to the inflation rate
so you get your moneys worth back

cuz if something is worth $10 at the start and then worth $10.50 at the end of a loan

if you loan out $100 you can get 10 of those things

at the end you can only get 9

so you charge interest and ask for $105 instead, so you can still get 10 things

and that isnt even counting the opportunity cost of not having $100 for a year
