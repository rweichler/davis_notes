Required Reserve Ratio: % of money deposited into a bank you need to keep reserved
    set by the Federal Reserve
    banks *cannot* loan it out
    they  keep it at the federal reserve

maturity mismatch is the cause of financial crisis
what if many people came to the bank to withdraw their money
    6k people come in to get their money
    bank doesnt have the money
    bank goes bankrupt
    the fed takes over the bank
    ppl with loans still owe

1. What is the banks' incentive to lend?
    Money from interest
    if they could, they'd loan all their money outo

maturity mismatch = someone wants to withdraw, but the money is currently being lended out to someone long term

banks have incentive to lend out risky loans
    FDIC insured
    riskier loans have higher interest rate
    its not their money

Basic Idea Behing Balance Sheel
EVERYONE has a balance sheet. Yes, even You!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Uses of Funds = Sources of Funds
What you bought with the money = Where you got the money
Assets = Liability + Net Worth
Home Value = Loan Value + Equity Value
$1M = $800K + $200K

Banks also have a balance sheet
a bank's liability is the deposits (since they're money you loaned them)

exam question: federal fund market is called it beacuse the banks have accounts with the fed
    when they borrow money from each other, they borrow against those accounts

borrow from other banks: Federal Funds markets
borrow from the fed    : discount loans
net worth = bank capital

the required reserve ratio is from EVERYTHING including loans not just assets

bank assets include reserves, treasury bonds and loans
bank liabilities + net worth include depposits, borrowing, and bank capital (aka net worth)

nother exam Q: a "fully loaned out" bank means that the excess reserves will be 0

Two major functions of the Fed:
1: Prevent Financial Crises
TOOLS:
    Required Reserves from banks
    Discount Loans
        when the banks go into the trouble, the fed comes to the rescue and lends them money
    Bank Capital Regulation
2: Control the supply of money through monetary policy (Normal Times)
    Monetary policy means changing the supply of money thru the fed
TOOLS:
    Open Market Operations
    Discount Rate
    Required Reserve Ratio
