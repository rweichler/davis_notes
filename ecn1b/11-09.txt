R = (F - P(B))/P(B)
R: rate of return
F: face value / future value
P(B): price of the bond (what you paid for the bond initially)

pay $80 for a bond, get $100 when you cash it in, rate of return is 25%
R = (100 - 80)/80 = 25%

if price level incerases u want more money and less bonds
interest rate increases u want to hold less money and more bonds

incerasing price level makes people want to hold more money, push up interest rate

when you go to a low enough interest rate, then demane for money just goes infinite
its fukin crazy dude

whoa

hold MONEY

FALLING INTO THE LIQUIDITY TRAP: excessive increase in M

IMG_1008.JPG

fed printed a shitton of money in order to lower the interest rates BUT THEY fuck ed up so like yeah its just kinda screwed now we're fucked

increase in money supply -> lowered interst rate!!!!!
    BUT IF U DO IT TOO MUCH THEN U DONT LOWER THE INTEREST RATE
    THAT MUCH AND U GET FUCKED OVER
in the long run if we increase money supply: inflation
    AND PRICES (PRICE LEVEL) INCREASE
        AND DEMAND FOR MONEY INCREASES
            FISCHER EFFECT!!!!!!!!!!

the moral of the story is: the fed can lower the interst rate in the short run for bad times,
but it cant do it over the long run because then u fuck everyone over with the fischer effect???
