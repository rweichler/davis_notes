final is gonna be harder than last midterm
read chapter 12 on your own during thankxgiving brake

Keynesian Consumption Function
C: y axis
Y(d): x axis
linear function:
C = 100 + 0.9 * Y(d)
MPC = (change in C)/(change in Y(d))
the y intercept is like the shit you need to buy? idk

C = C(0) + MPC*Y(d)
C = C(0) + MPC*(Y - TX + TR)
increase in income
change in C = +MPC * (change in Y)
example: change in C = +0.90 * 100 = +90
increase in taxes
change in C = -MPC * (change in TX)
example: change in C = -0.90 * 100 = -90
increase in transfer payments
* its the same as increase in income

How Does a Change in Aggregate Demand Affect Real GDP?

change in AD ----------> change in Y
A Two-Step Answer:
1. How does a change in AD affect Y assuming a fixed P?
    suppose for the time being, prices are fixed. lets fix prices.
    if demand for my pizza increases, i cant increase the price.
        so i produce more.
        AD up --> Y < AD --> Inventories down (unplanned) --> Y up --> Y = AD
    suppose aggregate demand goes down and i cant change my prices.
        so now i produce less until demand meets production
        AD down --> Y > AD --> Inventories up (unplanned) --> Y down --> Y = AD
2. How does a change in P affect Y?

Quantity Adjustment and GDP

If firms respond to change in demand by changing production quantities,

Step 1: change in I = +100 ----------> change in Y = ?

if business firms decide to buy more computers (100), AD will increase by 100
    thats fuckin WRONG

Multiplier Process
Y = C + I + G + EX - IM
Y(d) = Y - TX + IR
C = 100 + 0.9*Y(d)
suppose......
change in I = +100
people want +100 worth of laptops
so ppl produce more laptops (+100)
change in Y = +100
we are not stopping here!!!!!
since GDP increases, peoples income increases
companies are gonna hire more ppl to produce more laptopz
change in Y(d) = +100
if disposable income increases, then what!??
consumption increases
change in C = 0.90 * 100 = 90
they go out and buy 90 worth of beer
demand for beer increases by 90 units
what will happen to GDP next time!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
change in Y = 90
change in Y(d) = 90
change in C = 0.90 * 90 = 81
demand for chocolate is 81
change in Y = 81
change in Y(d) = 81

^^^ THIS IS CALLED THE MULTIPLIER PROCESS ^^^^^

change in Y = 100 + 90 + 81 + 72.9 + ...
change in Y = 100 + 0.9*100 + 0.9^2*100 + 0.9^3*100 + ...
change in Y = 100 * (1 + 0.9 + 0.9^2 + 0.9^3 + 0.9^4 + ...)

infinite series yo

change in Y = 100 * 1/(1 - 0.9) = 100 * 10 = 1000
change in Y = 100 * 1/(1 - MPC)

HOW IS IT POSSIBLE for change in I = 100, but change in Y = 1000???
consumption increases by 900

Expenditure Multiplier
change in Y = (change in AD)/(1 - MPC)

Step 2: How does a change in P affect Y?

Aggregate Demand Function

if prices (P) goes down
if price of coke goes down are we gonna buy more or less coke????
    buy more!!
    substitution effect.... we buy more cocaine because pepsi is more expensive

LETS SAY PRICE OF EVERYTHING GOES DOWN 5%...
    is there substitution effect!????
    is there income effect!????
        yeah breh

    OUR REAL WEALTH WILL INCREASE
    WEALTH/P GOES UP LOL CUZ P IS DOWN
