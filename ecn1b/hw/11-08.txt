1. M*V = P*Y, 2.4

P = gdp deflator = $100

2. real wage = (nominal wage)/P = 400
3. inflation rate = 3% - 1% = 2%
4. nominal interest rate = real interest rate + inflation rate = 2% + 2% = 4%
5. same as 3 and 4 with diff numbers, 2% (lol wtf they give it to you in the problem), 8%
6. just look at the graph, 4%
7. 40*150% = 60, so just look at where 40 is. 6%
8. look at the graph, 3%
9. 60 * 150% = 90
10. look at the graph, 30
