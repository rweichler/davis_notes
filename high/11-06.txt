so like

a touch screen tv would be pretty cool
but they would be fucking expensive

just get a leap motion
and some sort of rotation gyroscope shit to put on the TV


build it on top of tweetbot
    its already putting free software on top
    of proprietary software

    just do the same thing for tweetbot
    they almost copy the model to a T.
    seriously.

    plus you can just pirate it
