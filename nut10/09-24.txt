How Do We Express Nutrient Requirements & What Does It Mean?
Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) (the shit on Nutrition Facts food label)

RDA = meets the needs of NEARLY all healthy people (not a minimum or avg need)

-determined for protein & other nutrients
-established for diff age groups, gender, physiological state (preggo, lactating)
-designed to be averaged over several days
-adjustments made for diet quality, bioavailability, losses due to food preparation

RDA is usually 1.5 standard deviations above the average

DIGESTION:
process by which food is broken down into a form that can be absorbed in the intesting
26ft long

physical digestion: mouth, esophagus, stomach (moving and griding food)
