Digestive System

stomach does the most of your digestion
    turns it into a smoothie basically
    4 cup capacity

CHEMICAL DIGESTION

majority of it happens in the top part of the small intestine

uses enzymes to break down chemicals

protein, carbs, fat (macronutrients, energy nutrients)
^ answer to question #1 quiz 1 ^^^^

eventually the food gets broken down into small enouogh units to where it can pass through the intestinal track wall

large intestine deals with your shit

stomach has a little bit of chemical digestion

mouth -> stomach -> small intestine (pancrease works on it a bit) -> small intestine takes out the nutrients -> large intestine

villi: lines the esophagus, stomach, small intestine.
    lots of surface area


# of bacteria: about the same size as your brain

we have a really clean food supply:
    need kefir and shit (has friendly bacteria) to balance that out

CHAPTER 2: Protein

**NOTE: do all of the quizzes in the workbook, you get a grade boost
    chapter quizzes at the end of each chapter

High Protein Diets - Do They Work?

What we will cover about protein
    -Structure (food & body proteins)
    -Function
    -Meeting needs (requirement and food sources)

Protein -- means  "primary"

Early scientists knew protein was vital for life. They thought protein was a single substance with the element Nitrogen

early 1900s they found a bunch of different types of proteins
all proteins caontained NITROGEN
a source of NITROGEN was essential in the diet

comparison: beef protein vs blood protein

they have 2 different 3-dimensional shapes
twisted rope (purposeful, carry out a specific function that the animal needs it for)

chain of linked subunits (amino acid, 20 different kinds)
peptide bonds keep the amino acids together
    C, O, H, N atoms make up amino acids

amino group is where the nitrogen is
then theres an acid end
amino group links to acid end to chain them together
amino side and acid side are the same, just the R section defines what kind of amino acid it is

protein is determined by the sequencing of the amino acids

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\

hemoglobin with "typo" cant bind oxygen very well (sickle cell disease)

9 of the 20 amino acids are essential - can't be made in the body

other 11 - make from other items in the diet and source of nitrogen
    u cant breathe in the nitrogen, you have to get it in some edible form that resembles the amino side

FUNCTION OF PROTEIN
Energy, Structure, Regulation

1. Structure
    Bone
    Connective tissue (collagen)
2. Energy
    released from chemical bonds
    only really use it when you're starving
3. Regulatory
    hormones - insulin
        NOT ALL HORMONES ARE MADE FROM PROTEINS
    enzymes - catalyst
        vitamins  & minerals allow enzymes to work
    immune system
    fluid balance

digestion stretches the protein and unfold them
enzyme: protease (enzyme from pancreas)
    separates the amino acids
the end product of protein digestion is the individual amino acids


DIET PROJECT (page 282) worth 10% of your grade, pass/no pass
