complete protein sources:
eggs, poultry, beef, fish, soy, dairy, protein powder
incomplete:
nuts, rice, wheat, seeds

you can combine incomplete protein sources to get your good amount of daily value

2 ways to figure out if you have a good protein source:
1. protein efficiency ratio (PER)
    feed diet with test protein to lab rats
    measure how much weight is gained relative to food eaten
    PER = (weight gained)/(protein eaten)
    fish has the highest score
2. chemical score
    get % of each of the 9 essential amino acids by weight for egg white
    get % of each essential amino acid by weight for w/e you're testing against
    find the weakest link (limiting amino acid)
    w/e that is, is your answer. multiply by 100
    egg white has a score of 100
    fish has like 95, soy has like 92 etc etc
    for example white flour has a score of 30 and has lysine as a limiting acid

WHEY HAS HIGH LEUCINE PROTEIN
    leucine is good for starting the synthesis of proteins
    good post-workout


.8g /Kg per day is NEEDED
11% protein must be essential amino acids

.8g/Kg per day is also needed for infants
but 40% protein must be essential amino acids

the reason is because the child is growing

like, an adult could just eat bread all day and get their need
but infants cannot do that because you'd need to eat a shit ton of bread
like 4x as much. thats already a shitton for an adult

strict vegetarian == vegan
    no milk, egg, fish, poultry, meat
    have been practiced for thousands of years

health considerations:
    vegetable protein based diets may decrease risk for chronic diseases compared to animap protein based diets.
    heart disease, certain cancers, type 2 diabetes
    vegetarians tend to weigh less
    you live longer if you're vegetarian
    you live longer if you're vegetarian + eat fish
    but it might be because you're more conscious of your health, like u exercise more n shit
    
CHAPTER 3: ENERGY
Energy in foods
Energy requirement for your body to function

Ability to do work:
    Metabolic (building a muscle)
    Physical (going across the street)

Food -> Carbohydrate
        Protein
        Fat

These all have carbon (C)
Contain potential energy

Lavoisier made a comparison between fire and a living animal

it takes in oxygen (air) and carbon (from bread), releases CO2, and creates heat

melted ice to measure the energy
put a mouse next to it or the bread next to it or w/e
