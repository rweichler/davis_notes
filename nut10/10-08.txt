ENERGY

need to figure out a way to quantify the energy value of your food
potential energy in chemical bonds are released -> HEAT

if we eat it, we assume we get the same shit, not really but kinda the same

Calorie = 1000 calories = 1Kcal
1 Kcal = Heat needed to raise 1 liter of H20 1 degree Celsius

bomb calorimeter
light food on fire and measure temperature change

if you put in pure:
    carbs:   4.2 Kcal/g
    protein: 5.7 Kcal/g
    fat:     9.4 Kcal/g


How Much Energy Do You get When You Eat Carbohydrate?
PE: cabohydrate (4.2 Kcal/g) -> 5% in digestion is lost in stool -> body gets 4Kcal/g
fat -> 5% lost in stool -> 9 Kcal/g
protein -> 10% lost in stool (15% if you're vegan) -> energy loss in urine (N -> urea) -> 4Kcal/g
what the body gets is called the Physiological Fuel value
    Carbs & Protein: 4Kcal/g
    Fat:             9Kcal/g

the Calories on Nutrition Facts is for Physiological Fuel value (not PE)

fiber has 0 calories per gram. it only helps you poop. it might have PE but no Physiological Fuel value
water, cholesterol, vitamins and minerals have no calories

iWhy do we need calories?

1. Basal metabolic rate (BMR)
    basic bodily functions
    your brain thinking
    heart pumping blood
    breathing
2. Activity (equal to or less than BMR)
3. Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)
    digestion and shit
4. Growth (maybe not for adults)

Calorie Balance
Calorie intake vs. Calorie output
Undereating vs overeating

3500 calorie excess  = gain 1 lb.
3500 calorie deficit = lose 1 lb.

Computing BMR

Body weight taken into account

Men: 1kcal/(kg * hr)
Women = 0.9kcal/(kg * hr)

guys need more bcuz of more muscle

Example:
    Female -- 55kg
    0.9 * 55kg * 24hr/day = 1188kcal/day

Factors That Change BMR

1. Age: with increase in age, BMR decreases > 20 years, decrease 2-3% every 10 years
2. Fasting: decreases BMR ~10-20%
    happens within 24 hours
3. Exercise: increases BMR (variable effect)

Do supplements help boost your metabolism?
    yeah... kinda
    green tea does a lil bit

Energy requirement compontnt: Activity

Category                = % BMR added
-------------------------------------
Sedentary                   +  30%
Light                       +  50%
Moderate                    +  70%
Strenuous                   + 100%


most ppl are sedentary
light = bike to class
moderate = every day at gym, bike to class
strenuous = straight up caveman, competitive sports 5+hr practice per day and shit, construction worker

Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)
Energy needed for:
    Digestion of food
    Assimilation of food

5-10% of total caloric intake
TEF approx. 50 -> 200kcal

Compute to kinda get an idae
5% of the sum (BMR + activity) = TEF
example: BMR = 1000kcal/day
         activity (light) = 500kcal/day

TEF = 5%(1000 + 500)
    = .05 (1500)
    = 75kcal

EX: What is her energy requirement?

Female -- 52kg, strenuous activity

BMR =       1123 kcal
Activity =  1123 kcal
TEF =       112 kcal
---------------
total       2358 kcal/day

CARBOHYDRATES
Structure
Food sources (peach vs potato)
Metabolism

definition: hydrated water carbon
traps the suns energy as water and carbon

Function: energy nutrient, 1/2 total calories. In body, energy crucial for brain, muscles

Chemical Structure
3 levls--all in foods and body
1. monosaccharides
2. disaccharides
3. polysaccharaides

Monosaccharides
one sugar
simple carbs, simple sugars
6 carbon ring = sugar
Glucose - basic sugar unit (blood, starch, 1/2 table sugar)
Fructose - fruit sugar, sweeter
Galactose - comes from lactose - 1/2 milk sugar

Disaccharides
two sugars
simple carbs, simple sugars
Sucrose - table sugar, brown sugar (glucose + fructose)
