CARBOHYDRATES (contd)

Dissacharides
Maltose - breakdown unit from starch, found in malt, seed/bean sprouts (glucose + glucose)
Lactose - milk sugar (glucose + galactose)

honey has more carbs per unit mass than table sugar ????/

iHigh Fructose Corn Syrup vs. Table Sugar

High fructose corn syrup has no bond between the fructose and glucose
Sucrose has the bond
the proportions of fructose and glucose is about the same for both

Polysaccharides
many sugars
Starch: hundredes of glucose in long chains
In plants: vegetables, grains, unripe fruit
Called complex carbohydrates
starch is NOT A FOOD SOURCE
Potatoes: the inside is starch
          the skin is fiber.... hundreds of clucose units or other monos linked in long chains
          they also make up the cell wall
Glycogen: animal "starch" made from hundreds of glucose
          units in a long chain with many branches.
          glycogen is stored in the muscle and liver of
          humans and animals but NO food source.

it lasts for 24-36 hours if you're just chillin
it will last 2-3.5 hours if you're doin work

artificial sweeteners are NOT carbs
    used in diet sodas
    not bad for you

saliva breaks down polysaccharides, but not fiber
    if you chew a bagel for like 5 min it starts to taste different (maltose)

small intestine has specific enzymes to break up all of the disaccharides
    Maltase, Lactase, Sucrase

the whole "not eating lactose makes you intolerant" holds some truth for some people
    but most of the time it doenst make a difference

FIBER

Structural material in plants
Inedigestible carbohydrate

TWO types of fiber
1. Water-insoluble: cellulose, hemi-cellulose
    Sources: grains, vegetables, whole grains
    it doesnt dissolve in water, but it grows and swells up

    it holds water in your intestinal tract
    and pushes on your intestinal tract, moves your shit forward
    ultimately speeds the passage of waste
    helps with constipation

most people are consuming 50% of their recommended fiber intake

constipation = straining to have a bowel movement
more than half the population has hemmeroids, and pregnant chicks have it too usually

diverticula is a long term effect of a low-fiber diet
    small pouches that protrude; when filled with food
    particles & waste, diverticulitis develops (inflammation,
    cramping)

Health benefits of water-insoluble fiber
    Relieves constipation
    Prevents hemorrhoids
    helps prevent intestinal disease and cancer

2. Water-soluble: gums, pectins
    Sources: fruits, beans, oats

    -Forms gel
    -Binds cholesterol
    -Aids in satiety - stomach filling, better blood glucose control: role in weight loss/control
        it takes out cholesterol in your large intestine, preventing it from
        osmosing itself back into your blood stream

    WATER SOLUBLE FIBER MAKES YOU LESS HUNGRY HELPS U LOSE WATE
