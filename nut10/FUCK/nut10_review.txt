bones: store calcium, take a few years to get it out
digestion: stomatch, small intestine
    breaking it down into a form
    that can be absorbed by the small
    intestine
absorption: small intestine
RDA: healthy people, not minimum, avg over several days
    age groups, gender, physiological state
    diet quality, bioavailability, losses due to food prep

RDA for protein
    0.8 g/kg body weight
PROTEIN DAILY VALUE <---- will be in exam
    50 grams

FOOD SOURCES FOR COMPLETE PROTEIN:
    fish, milk, beef, soy
FOOD SOURCES FOR INCOMPLETE PROTEIN:
    beans, rice, wheat

    limiting amino acid:
        the essential amino acid, in food protein that is the lower amount relative to need.

CARBS: monosaccharide
4kcal/g
function: energy
storage: animals: glycogen; plants: starch, cellulose
    we store it in our liver and our muscle

Fiber
water-insoluble:
    whole grains, veggies
water-soluble:
    fruit, legumes, oat bran
20-35g/day recommended intake
25g DV

Fat
unit: triglyceride
function: structure (cell membrane)
          regulatory (EFAs for hormone and prostaglandin synthesis)

Obesity
body weight > 20% above desirable

body fat %:
> 25% men
> 35% women

BMI >= 30 (weight kg / height^2 m^2)

abdominal obesity
men > 40 in
women > 35 in
> risk for chronic diseases (heart diseas, high blood pressure, insulin resistance)

3x fat cell # increases
3rd trimester -> 1 yr
adolescent growth spurt 12-14 yrs
adulthood gain in fat cell number if weight gain stimulus
1-2 lb/yr just cells getting bigger

when you lose weight you lose fat size
childhood obesity is dangerous so they have more fat cell numbers

obesity health risks
cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, cancer, osteoarthritis, emotional disturbances

coronary artery disease risk factors
smoking cigs
hypertension
hypercholesterolemia (high LDL, low HDL)
diabetes
heredity
increasing age
obesity (abdominal)
maleness
inactivity

bioavailabileity: portion of the mineral content in food that is utilized by the body
1. physiological condition
2. medication
3. meal composition
4. food factor
5. status for the mineral

pregnant chicks absorb more calcium
non-veem iron + vitamin C = more bioavailability for iron
low in iron -> increase bioavail of iron

Calcium
function: structural (bones and teeth), regulatory, nerve impulses
deficiency: osteoporosis, weak / porus bones ********
    HOW YOU DEVELOP IT AND HOW ITS AT RISK
food source:
    dairy, tofu, molasses, salmon, fish sauce, green leafy veggies

what alters bioavailability for calcium?
    pregnancy, vitamin D (positive correlation),
    phytates/oxalates (leafy greens/veggies, hang onto calcium and excrete in body)

Sodium
mostly regulatory
extracellular idk what that means
controlled by kidney
maintanence for fluid balance
deficiency: sudden loss of body fluids, sweat a lot
symptom dizziness and fatigue
found in cheese

Potassium
also regulatory
found in intracellular fluids, processed by kidney
fluit balance
eat more potassium and less sodium
    if you dont you get hypertension, high blood pressure -> heart disease
deficiency:
    sudden loss of body fluids

Trace minerals
present in the body in small amounts (<.01% of body weight)
required in small amounts < 50mg/day
basic function: most regulatory functions in our body


Iron ***
for regulation
oxygen transport
energy metabolism

deficiency:
    protective mechanisms in our body to prevent it cuz its so important
    recycle from dead red blood cells
    store it in bone marrow + spleen in case
    increase the absorption in our intestines
bioavailability:
    low amount of hemoglobin in the blood results in anemia. women/children at higher risk
    you can get anemia from other vitamins and minerals
        like vitamin E, B12, fullate
    high iron stores = good iron status:
        absorption is decreased
    poor iron stores = poor iron status:
        increased absorption

sources:
heme: meat/blood bioavail 20-30% pretty good
non-heme: plants (eg legumes) bioavail 5-20%
about 10% total
bioavailability:
    vitamin C +
    meat +
    oxalate/phytate -
    fiber/tannins - (chocolates and shit)
    eat the shit separately

Iodine
the intake of this mineral can be linked to geographical location
functions:
    incorporated into thyroid hormone
    regulate oxygen utilization
    maintain BMR
deficiency:
    goiter-enlarged thyroid gland
        gross ballsack around your neck
    cretinism
food sources?
    iodized salt, fruit, vegetables grown in iodine rich soil

Zinc
functions: regulatory
    acts as a cofactor (encyme helper) reactions in replication
    growth/sexual maturation
    wound healing
    immune function
    taste perception
deficiency:
    impared *
    reduced sperm count
food sources?
    oysters, clams, a lot of seafood
    a lot of meat products too
    steak, chicken and shit
bioavailability
    kinda like iron
    itate/oxilate -
    tanin/fiber -

Fluoride
dont need to know this



___Vitamins____
ORGANIC SUBSTANCES (containing carbon) that are ESSENTIAL in the diet
FUNCTION AS REGULATORS and do not provide energy
not common in structure
REQUIRED IN SMALL AMOUNTS compared to protein
requirement for vitamins for animals and humans are different
minerals: we need the same amount as animals basically

Classes of vitamins:
WATER SOLUBLE (C and B's)
found in watery parts of cells
exces is excreted in urine, no storage
fast turnover rate, requirement must be met on regular basis
coenzyme
clinical signs of deficiency develop in 6-8 weeks

FAT SOLUBLE (A D E K)
found in fatty tissue
excess is stored (eating a lot of A is toxic)
slow turnover rate-less frequent requirement
function in more general roles, no coenzymes
clinical signs of deficiency take years to develop

progression of w-soluble vitamin deficiency
clinical lesion (visible signs)
    skin disorders
    sore mouth, tongue, intestinal problems
    muscle fatigue
    anemia

    smooth purple tongue

VITAMIN C
regulatory
    making collagen, keeping teeth together
    increased Fe absorption
    antioxidant
deficiency:
    scurvy-swollen bleeding gums, loose teeth, painful joints, fragile bones, hemorrhages under

B vitamins are involved in energy metabolism
we can make niacin in our body, we can make it out of an amino acid???

Thiamin (Vitamin B1)
deficiency: beriberi: central nervous system dysfunction, muscle fatigue, heart failure
source: pork, enriched full grains

Niacin (B3)
deficiency:
    dermatitis, diarrhea, delirium, death
    part of the bodys niacin can be made from EAA tryptophan
food source: fish, grain, poultry, legumes

B12 & Folate
making in nucleic acid synthesis and makes new cells
folate is needed for pregnancy
special points about B12: ***
    requires intrinsic factor for absorption
    colbalt is part of B12s structure
    liver stores it
    it is only found in animals or fermented food

deficiency
    folate - anemia
    " during preggo - birth defects
    B12 - pernicious anemia
food sources:
    folate - liver, OJ, veggies, fortified grains
    B12 - fish, miso, kiimchi, fermented cabbage


Whole grain, refined grains
need to draw a whole grain
need to draw a refined grain

whole: Bran/Hull, starch inside, germ inside
refinement: get rid of bran/hull, take starch out... just have carbs
enrichment: inject shit into the refined starch

bran layers/hull: fiber, B vitamins, minerals
starch: empty carbs
germ: minerals, B vitamins, vitamin E

nutritional differences between whole grain and refined grain:
during milling/refining kernel, the bran layer/hull and germ. lose fiber, B1, B2, B3, B6, folate, iron, zinc, magnesium

whole grains also have phytochemicals abundant in whole foods
    prevents cancer or initiation of cancer
lowered risk of chronic diseases

fat soluble vitamins
Vitamin A
function: regulatory
    vision cycle
    epithelial tissue ****
        cells that line other tissue (skin, urinary tract, intestines)
    bone growth
deficiency:
    night blindness
    xeropthalmia (dry eyes)
    bone growth stops
    keratinization (skin gets shitty)
why do changes with the skin and sinus occur with deficiency?
    your nose is lined with epithelial tissue

Vitamin A toxicity
    bone decalcification
    birth defects
    death
    toxicity of beta carotene:
        safe, only skin pigmentation
good food sources?
    liver, steak, meat
food sources of beta carotene?
    carrot, sweet potato, any orange vegetable or fruit


Vitamin D
help us absorb calcium, cholesterol
deficiency: exposure to sunlight a factor
    child rickets (adult: osteo malatia)
    bone deformation
toxicity:
    child-bone malformation
food source: vitamin D milk, fish, egg, sunlight on skin

Vitamin E
regulatory
antioxidant, important in cell membranes
deficiency:
    hemolytic anemia
    fragile red blood cells
found in: vegetable oil, whole grain, wheat germ

veggie/vegan diet concerns:
protein: soy products, beans & rice
vitamin B12: kimchee, sauerkraut, fortified grains
iron: non-heme iron with vitamin C
    ex: beans or fortified cereal with orange juice
calcium: broccoli, tofu, soymilk

alcohol and nutrition
it has energy, 7kcal/g!
- ingestion of vitamin C
- ingestion of thiamin, folic acid, B12, iron
interferes with metabolism of niacin, vitamin D, B6, A
+ excretion of B6, calcium, zinc, folic acid, magnesium
it also has potential energy

Empty calorie:
    foods that supply little or none in the way of essential nutrients relative to their calorie count
    candy and shit

nutrient dense foods to substitute empty calorie foods
    fruits, vegetables

dietary recommendations to lower risk for cancer
maintain healthy body weight/avoid weight gain with a ge
eat five or more servings of colorful fruits and veggies daily
    orange, yellow and leafy types: cabbage, radish, broccoli
choose whole grain over refined
limit intake of salt-cured, smoked, and charbroiled foods, and reduce red meat intake
consume alcoholic beverages in moderation

SoFAS
solid fat & added sugars found in foods/beverages that americans eat - we avg about 35%kcal/day
example of dietary components:
solid fat: beef, butter, lard
added sugar: white sugar, corn syrup, HFCS, honey, agave

food source of SoFAs:
energy drinks, cookies, ice cream, bacon

Dietary Guidelines
3 key rationales ***
1. maintain a healthy weight
2. promotion of overall health
3. prevention of diet-related chronic diseases

four areas
2. food and components to reduce
    aka SoFAs

MyPlate **
2 cups of fruit daily
2.5 cups veggies
make 1/2 grains whole
3 cups of  fat-free or low-fat milk or milk products daily
8 oz/week from a variety of seafood (avg 250mg daily of omega 3 fats)
replace some meats with seafood, beans, nuts & seeds
replace solid fats with small amounts of oils

^ multi choice
