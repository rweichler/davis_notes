1. triglycerides make up majority of fat in diet
2. functions of fat:
    source of energy
    precursor to sex hormones
    protecting vital organs
3. if mostly saturated fat, itll be hard at room temp
4. coconut oil's veggie fats are hella different from other veggies
5. typical plant source fats are soybean oil and corn oil:
    they are liquid
    high in polyunsaturated fatty acid content
6. bile in digestion is for:
    solubilize fat
    emulsify fats into smaller particles
    NOT:
        enhance glucose absorption
        initiate starch digestion (u cant digest starch)
7. hydrogenation:
    makes fats more solid
    converts it to trans fat
    more resistant to oxidation (more stable)
    NOT:
        adds more cholesterol
8. safflower oil contains highest proportion of linoleic acid:
        linoleic acid is a fatty acid
        butter, palm oil, olive oil have less proportion
9. fat's insolability in water:
    influences digestion
    influences absorption
    influences transport through the circulation
10. prostaglandins:
        hormone-like substances involved in inflammation + blood clotting
        made from essential fatty acids
            linoleic (18:2)
            linoleic (18:3)
11. cholesterol:
    made in the liver
    is converted to bile
    is converted to Vitamin D
    is incorporated into cell membranes
12. lipoprotein:
    the transport form of fat and cholesterol in the circulation
13. olestra:
    contains PE
    not digestible
    provides 0 calories/gram when consumed
14. cholesterol does NOT move freely around the body through the blood stream independent and not part of lipoproteins
15. energy stored in the body as:
    triglyceride
16. end products of aerobic fat energy metabolism:
    C02, H20, energy
    same as carb energy metabolism (aerobic)
17. excess protein is converted to:
    fatty acids/TG
18. 1 day of fasting = most glycogen is gone
19. glucose cant be made from fat
    fasting ppl break down muscles to make glucose
20. keto works cuz u lose a lot of water
    (no glycogen left, energy utilization shift)
21. chylomicron:
    transport form of fat in the bloodstream
    directly from a meal
22. High Density Liporpteins (HDL):
    thought to protect against cardiovascular disease
23. type 2 diabetes:
    elevated fasting blood glucose levels
24. reduce risk for cardiovascular disease:
    30% or less fat intake out of all calories
25. obesity != overconsumption of sugar
26. blood cholesterol level 265mg/dl = high risk for cardiovascular disease
27. gradual weight gain (1-2 lbs/yr):
    increase in fat cell size
28. fat loss:
    calorie intake < calorie expenditure
29. 280mg/day of cholesterol reduces heart disease
30. BMI = weight vs. height
31. android/apple shaped obesity:
    high incidence of diabetes,
    high blood pressure,
    heart disease
32. fat cell # either does not vary little from one indiv to the next
    OR
    fat cell number is not around 5 billion for everyone
33. anorexia:
    eating disorder
    characterized by self-induced starvation
