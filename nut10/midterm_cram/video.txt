fat is a trycliceride
    glycerol + 3 fatty acids

fat:
    energy
        9 kcal/gram
    regulation
        essential fats - prostaglandins (nerves)
            lineleic and linelenic (18:2, 18:3)
        hormones - sex hormones
    structure
        insulation
        membrane structure

2 categories:
    saturated
        no double bonds
            C16, C18 (lamitic, stearic)
        food sources
            beef, dairy, whole milk
    unsaturated
        one or more double bonds
        mono (C18:1) or poly (C18:2, C18:3, fatty acids)
        ex:
            mono:
                olive oil
            poly:
                sunflower oil, soybean, corn oil

essential fatty acids
    cannot make in sufficient quantities
    18:2 linoleic
    18:3 linolenic (omega-3) fatty acids
    sources:
        corn oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil (18:2), fatty fish,tuna  salmon, flaxseed oil/meal (18:3)

hydrogenation
    add hydrogens to double bonds of unsaturated fatty acid
    longer shelf life
    unsaturated are unstable liquids
    saturated are way more stable
    food sources:
        margarine
        crisco
        cookies made with margarine
    it decreases essential fatty acid content
    corn oil (high omega 6) -> GG.
    liquid -> solid
    forms trans fatty acid
        detrimental to heart health
    doesnt change caloric content or cholesterol content
        why? cholesterol is not a fatty acid

animal vs plant

ANIMAL FAT
    more saturated than unsaturated
    solid at room temp
    por source of essential fatty acids
    exceptions -
        fish oil, salmon, tuna
VEGGIE FAT
    unsaturated more
    liquid at room temp
    good source of essential fatty acids
    exceptions -
        coconut oil, palm oil
        tropical oiils and are more saturateed ^

butter = saturated
corn oil = polyunsaturated (18:3)
avocado = monounsaturated
salmon = polyunsaturated (omega 3)
meat = saturated
margarine = trans fat

which foods provide 18:2 / 3?
salmon = 3
cocunot oiil = saturated NOPE
olive oil = monounsaturated NOPE
corn oil = 2
walnuts = 3, omega-3

cholesterol?
butter? yea saturated
cocunot oil? no saturated
palm oil? no saturated
cheese? yea saturated, from animal
margarine? comes from vegetable fat, no cholesterol


fat insoluble in water, influences digestion absorption and transport


DIGESTION
starts in small intesting

bile is produced in the liver, stored in gallbladder

once digested, tryclicerides are broken down by bile
bile is basically a soap basically

combo = miscelle

chyylomicron NEEDS TO BE FORMED IN INTESTING CUZ ITS SOLUBLE
enters circulation
**** chylomicron goes from intesting to liver

components of lipoprotein:
    fatty acids, cholesterol, protein (makes it soluble)


fat transport
    chylomicron comes from intestine
    it can drop of a trygliceride to a fat or muscle cell
    or it can go to the liver and goes out as VLDL
    then the VLDL can drop off trycliceride to cells, then
        it turns into a LDL
    job of LDL? drop off triglycerides to cells
        drops off cholesterol
    also from liver = HDL
        extra cholesterol from cells -> liver

CHOLESTEROL
    fatt wax-like substance in the body that performs essential functions:
    membrane structure (LDL drops it off for structure)
    precursor to bile acids (why it needs to come back to liver)
    precursor to sex hormones
    precursor to vitamin D
    NOT an essential nutrient (we can make it in our bodies)
    non-egg food source?
        liver
        chicken
        milk, cheese, etc
        any animal product

ENERGY METABOLISM
consideration of energy needs
1. following a meal
2. several hours after eating
3. 24-36 hours fasted

glycogen stores for 24-36 hours
    broken down into glucose
    metabolized for energy
    broken down and oxidized for energy
    and into 3 carbon units
amino acids
    amino acid pool can be used for energy
    also into 3 carbon units
    you piss out the nitrogen


what hapepns after a meal?
    energy nutrients abundant
    need to be put into storage for later
    carbs:
        glucose is stored as glycogen in muscle and liver
        excess is converted to fat and put in fat stores
    fat:
        tryglicerides and fatty acids
        also stored as fat
    protein:
        broken down into amino acids
        first to replace your protein needs
        any leftover, nitrogen stripped off and stored as fat as well
several hours after eating?
    they're stored away now
    can be used
    glycogen is broken down into glucose
        mostly for brain energy, needs glucose
        can be used for other shit
    fat stores
        turned into fatty acids and energy
    protein?
        no protein!!!!!!
24 hours after fasting
    glycogen has run out
    glucose has to come from somewhere
    you're gonna use your body protein
        broken down into amino acids
        nitrogen ends up in urine
    fatty acids can be used for other tissues (not brain)
        ketones (dont want too much?)
            they are made from the fatty acids
            byproduct of metabolism
            some is oxidized immediately, but not all of it
            can be used for energy but should nt be in excess

coronary artery disease: risk factors
    cigarette smoking
    hypertension
    obesity
    increasing age
    male sex
    inactivity
    dietary factors
    heredity

dietary guidelines for prevention and treatment of heart disease
    total fat 25-35% of total calories
    saturated fat <7% of calories (limit trans fat)
    dietary cholesterol < 300mg/day
        limit for blood cholesterol < 200mg
    salt: 1500mg of sodium
    fiber: 25g
    limit alcohol


2350 calorie die with 95 grams of fat and 35 grams of saturated fat
are you following recommendations?

35% fat calories ---> grams
< 7 % saturated fat calories --> grams

2350 calories * 35% = 822.5 calories MAX as total fat

822.5cal/9cal/g = 91.4 grams of fat MAX


SO YOU'RE FUCKED!!!!!!!

same thing for saturated fat, but multiply by 7% saturated

you end up getting 18.3 saturated fat MAXXXXX

 SO YOU'RE ALSO FUCKED!

OBESITY

> 20% above desireable
> 25% men
> 35% women

**** BMI >= 30

normal = 18.5-24.9
overweight = 25-29.9
*** obese >= 30

*** waist measurment used as indicator
men > 40 inches, women > 35 inches

METABOLIC SYNDROME
clustering of at leaset 3 out of the folliwng 5 clinical measurments
    abdominal obesity
        (measure the wast)
    high fasting blood glucose
    high fasting blood triglycerides
    hyperdension (high blood pressure)
    low HDL

FAT TISSUE DEVELOPMENT
Critical periods: increase in fat cell #
    3rd trimester to 1 year (for fetus/infant)
    adolescent growth spurt (12-14 yrs)

WEIGHT GAIN
    during critical period can increase in cel # and size
    during adult years results in increase cell size and sometimes cell number

WEIGHT LOSS = decerases cell size but NOT cell number

OBESITY HEALTH RISKS
    cardiovascular disease
    hypercholesterollemia
    hypertension
    diabetes
    cancer (certain types)
    osteoarthritis
    emotional disturbances (discrimination issues)
THEORIES OF THE CAUSE OF OBESITY
    calorie imbalance
        kcal in > kcal out
    inactivity
        kcal out < kcal in
    genetic influence
        40-60% of all obesity is due to genetics,
        the chance of becoming obese is greater if
        a parent is obese
    thrifty metabolism
        decreased BMR
        kcal out < kcal in
    set point
        the body strives to maintain fat cell size/mass;
        if the fat cell size reduces, mechanisms
            encourage fat cell "filling" and fat gain
        chemical that plays a role?
            hormone..... leftin is released and sends
            the signal, turns off the hunger signal
    meal pattern
        skipping meals may increase fat stores by encur
    meal composition
        high fat diet
OBESITY TREATMENT
    energy restricted diet
        (reduced calories)
    behavior modification

BULIMIA:
    EAT HELLA, STOP EATING HELLA, over and over
    potassium loss
    fat-soluble vitamin loss (use of laxatives)
    teeth erosion due to stomach acid
    heart and organ failure
